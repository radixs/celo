# Notebook
Every run needs to have an environment defined (can be picked from the list in the future, for now 2D grid)
Also needs a spawn point and continuation point, optionally special points. Each point can have conditions.

The idea is to create a 2D grid where flow will start on spawn point and will try to navigate to the 
continuation point.

### Ideas to explore
Environment made up of json objects that the flow can interact with and change their states.

Captcha smasher.


First env tools - rope and the stick.

# Ultimate goal. Emergence.
A process whereby larger entities, patterns, and regularities arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities that themselves do not exhibit such properties.
