# Running

To launch the application you must have symfony cli installed. Then do:
```
symfony server:start
```

Every run needs to have an environment defined (can be picked from the list in the future, for now 2D grid)
Also needs a spawn point and continuation point, optionally special points. Each point can have conditions.

The idea is to create a 2D grid where flow will start on spawn point and will try to navigate to the 
continuation point.
